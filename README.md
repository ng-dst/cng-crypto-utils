# Labs 3-4: Cryptography Utilities (CU, zCU)

CU is a simple suite of cryptographic functions implemented as a library, as a command line tool, and as a GUI tool (zCU) for context menu. 
It's built on top of the CNG API and provides a simplified interface for common cryptographic operations.

## Features

- Encrypt files using symmetric algorithms and chaining modes
- Sign and verify files
- Hash files
- Create and export keys to key files
- Generate asymmetric key pairs
- Generate random bytes

## Usage

See [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) for more detailed usage guide in different scenarios.

### As a library

Include `cu.h` and use `CU_` functions. Here is a basic example of how to use CU to encrypt a file:

```c
#include "cu.h"

int main() {
    LPCTSTR szFileIn = "input.txt";
    LPCTSTR szFileOut = "input.txt.enc";
    LPCWSTR szAlgo = BCRYPT_AES_ALGORITHM;
    LPCWSTR szMode = BCRYPT_CHAIN_MODE_CBC;

    LPBYTE pbKey = (LPBYTE) "sixteen-byte-key";
    DWORD cbKey = 16;

    LPBYTE pbIv = (LPBYTE) "0123456789abcdef";  // NULL -> random IV
    DWORD cbIv = 16;

    // Create key blob
    LPBYTE pbKeyBlob = NULL;
    DWORD cbKeyBlob = 0;
    NTSTATUS status = CU_CreateKeyBlob(szAlgo, pbKey, cbKey, &pbKeyBlob, &cbKeyBlob);
    if (!NT_SUCCESS(status)) {
        // Handle error
    }

    // Encrypt file
    status = CU_EncryptFile(szFileIn, szFileOut, szAlgo, szMode, pbKeyBlob, cbKeyBlob, pbIv, cbIv);
    if (!NT_SUCCESS(status)) {
        // Handle error
    }

    // Erase and free key blob
    if (pbKeyBlob) {
        SecureZeroMemory(pbKeyBlob, cbKeyBlob);
        free(pbKeyBlob);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Many parameters are optional and have default values. For example, default algorithm is AES and default AES mode is CBC. IV can be NULL, and in that case, it will be generated randomly.

Most functions return `NTSTATUS` values, which are Windows error codes. You can use the `NT_SUCCESS` macro to check if the operation was successful.

Functions that require a pointer to a pointer to a buffer (e.g., `CU_CreateKeyBlob`) will allocate memory for the buffer. You should free this memory with `free` when you are done with it. Remember to zero out sensitive data before freeing (e.g. with `SecureZeroMemory`).

### As a command line tool

Here are some examples of how to use CU from the command line:

- To generate an AES-256 key and encrypt a file in CBC mode:

```bash
lab3.exe gen-key -a AES -c 256 -o key.bin
```

```bash
lab3.exe encrypt input.txt key.bin -o input.txt.enc -a AES -m CBC
```

- To generate a key pair for ECDSA_P256, then sign and verify a file:

```bash
lab3.exe gen-pair -s ECDSA_P256 -c 256 priv_key.bin pub_key.bin
```

```bash
lab3.exe sign input.txt priv_key.bin -s ECDSA_P256 -a SHA256 -o signature.bin
```

```bash
lab3.exe verify input.txt pub_key.bin signature.bin -s ECDSA_P256 -a SHA256
```

Most flags (`-a`, `-m`, `-s`, `-o`) are **optional** and can be omitted. The program will let you know when a specific flag is required.

For algorithms list, use `algo` command. For help, use `help`.

### As a Context menu GUI

There is a GUI wrapper: zCU. It is designed to be used in context menu, but it can be run from command line as well: \
`zcu.exe <command> [files...]`

First, build the tool and place binaries (`lab3.exe`, `zcu.exe`) to `build\` directory. 

Navigate to `shell\` and run `install.ps1`. Accept registry changes when prompted.

CU will be installed in `C:\Program Files\CU\`. To uninstall, run `uninstall.ps1` in CU directory.

To use zCU on a file, right-click on the file and navigate to `Cryptography` menu:
```
Cryptography ->
    Encryption ->
        Encrypt...
        Decrypt...
    Signing ->
        Verify...
        Sign...
    Hashing ->
        Hash...
```

To generate keys, right-click on an empty space in a directory and use that menu as well:
```
Cryptography ->
    Key Generation ->
        Generate key...
        Generate key pair...
```

A small zCU window with parameters and key file selection will pop up.

_Note:_ Not all algorithms, hashes, modes, etc. are compatible with each other by design.

_**If it says `Invalid parameter` or such, chances are you've actually picked wrong parameters.**_

## Internal Architecture

Here's a brief overview of CU architecture and execution flow:

1. **Argument Parsing (`argparse.c`):** parsing command-line arguments using the `ParseArgs` function. This function fills an `ARGUMENTS` structure with specified parameters.

2. **Command Execution (`work.c`):** After parsing the arguments, the `ExecCommand` function is called. This function calls the appropriate function based on the command.

3. **Cryptography Utilities (`cu` directory):** This directory makes a set of `CU_` functions for encryption, decryption, hashing, signing, and key generation.

    - **Encryption and Decryption (`encrypt.c`):** Symmetric key encryption. The key is read from key blob, and IV is passed as an argument or generated randomly.

    - **Hashing (`hash.c`):** Hashing operation for files.

    - **Signing and Verification (`sign.c`):** Signing and verification of files. Generates file hash and creates a signature file for that hash.

    - **Key Generation (`key.c` and `pubkey.c`):** Handling symmetric and asymmetric keys (create, import, export). The keys are saved to binary files.

4. **Error Handling (`error.c`):** Functions for printing error and usage messages.

<br>

As for zCU, it is a GUI wrapper that forms a command line for CU and executes it for each specified file. The code might seem complex but the concept is trivial. 

## Building

This project is built using CMake, as specified in the `CMakeLists.txt` file. The project is organized into a static library (`cu`) and two executables (`lab3.exe`, `zcu.exe`).

CU supports both Unicode and ANSI builds, while zCU always uses Unicode. For ANSI CU version, unset `UNICODE` in `CMakeLists.txt`. This repo's release channel has Unicode builds.

To build the project, follow these steps:

1. Create a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
2. Generate build files: `cmake ..`
3. Build the project: `cmake --build .`

## TODO

- Shell extension for context menu integration (lab 4) - **Done!**
- ~~GUI for easier key management (lab 5)~~ jk
